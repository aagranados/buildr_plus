# TODO

* Rework publish flag so it defaults to false
* Add deps list for jett
* Add templates for each project that automagically adds relevant aspects. i.e.
    - IDEA project facets
    - publish flags
    - facet based so can determine what elements are defined in each module.
    - auto module definition based on facets
* Rework features so they can be defined like facets in domgen with config
  and extension blocks. They should also be able to declare dependencies
